Learning a bit of Redux, so this takes the ReduxEssentials tutorial as a starting point...

This uses my wip [fitness tracker api](https://github.com/Jo-R/FitnessTracker) running locally as the back end so to run this you'll need to run that as well.

Uses create-react-app so npm i and npm start to run this.
